# Transform Self Love into Empathy
- Narcissism could develop due to lack of attention received by an individual
- Everyone is part of the narcissism spectrum, some more narcissistic than others
- Usually, we seek attention from family, friends, colleagues, etc to validate ourselves
- When we don't receive it, we feel discouraged or lack confidence. However, there are some that turn inwards, to the self, when this happens. It depends on how strong the sense of self is to differentiate the person from a _deep narcissist_ or a _functional narcissist_
- A deep narcissist, when insulted or challenged, has nothing internal to soothe them or validate their worth. They generally get angry or thirst for vengeance
- Deep narcissists can position themselves as victims, drawing sympathy. They can seem impatient when one talks about something that does not involve them. They turn conversations back to themselves
- Healthy narcissists, on the other hand, have a good sense of self. They do not need as much validation. They realize their limits and flaws at some point. They can direct their focus and love into their work
 
## Our task
1. Understand the phenomenon of Deep Narcissists
2. Be honest about our own nature and not deny it
3. Begin to make transformation into healthy narcissists

## Four Components of Empathic Skillset
1. **The empathic attitude** - Treat people as if they're a blank slate and you know nothing. Don't act based on your personal judgments
2. **Visceral Empathy** - Try to understand the tone, body language and mood of the person before even paying attention to what they're saying
3. **Analytic Empathy** - Treat people who are difficult to figure out as challenges to solve. Be ready to re-adjust previous judgments about them
4. **Empathic Skill** - Understand people deeply -- but for that you need feedback. You can ask directly about their thoughts and feelings to see if what you guessed was correct (provided you have that rapport with them). Or find out indirectly by seeing how the relationship between the two goes
 
## Types of Narcissistic People
1. **Complete control narcissist** - More ambitious than deep narcissists, greater insecurities, mimic empathy. They tend to communicate not to connect but to control and manipulate
2. **Theatrical narcissist** - They seem moral and altruistic, they show as if doing good, act as victim, play on your empathy
3. **Healthy narcissist** - Understands people's moods, empathizes, tries to indirectly understand them
