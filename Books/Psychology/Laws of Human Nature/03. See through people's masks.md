# See through people's masks
- We as humans, learn to fit in to groups by wearing same clothes and speaking the same language
- We become good at flattering people
- We learn how to conceal our feelings
- Our task as students of human nature should be first, to understand and accept the theatrical quality of life. How we need to use this quality to attract attention, dominate the limelight and make yourself sympathetic. Second, we should not be naive about people's appearances. We should become the master decoder of their true feelings
 
## Three aspects to this law
### Observational skills
- Pay attention to microexpressions.
- Try this exercise with someone, start observing their facial expressions, voice (changing in pitch), body language, etc
- Be relaxed and open to what you notice
- Make sure you listen to what they're saying and make it clear that you're doing so. This will relax them and potentially leak out some non verbal cues
- Also know the person's baseline before you observe them. Once you're aware of their baseline, it should be easier to notice any deviations
- Be careful about your biases when observing
- Keep your personal preferences and prejudices about the people out when observing
- Also observe yourself from time to time and how your expressions and body language changes in certain scenarios
 
### Decoding Keys
- Three categories of cues to identify:
    - Dislike/Like: People give out clear indications through their body language and expression when they like or dislike something. Observe these indications. For example, when someone genuinely smiles, their muscles around the eyes widen, pull cheeks upwards, etc. Understand these.
