# Mastering your Emotional Self
- First step to rationality is understanding the existence of fundamental irrationality
- Understand that sometimes we give out emotions that are not truly what we feel but showing what we really feel would be considered negative/bad
- For example, let's say you are angry with person X whereas the true source of this might be envy. But envy is not a feeling that we are comfortable showing or even feeling it ourselves. So we often show something that is more palatable like anger
- We don't always have conscious access to the original source of our emotions and the moods they generate. We can only try to understand it and translate into language. But sometimes emotions get lost in translation
- For animals, who don't have to translate emotions into language, emotions function pretty smoothly as they were meant to
