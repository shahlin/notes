# Atomic Habits

_This is a very high level summary as I've only heard the audiobook and not read the physical book_

## Making it part of your identity
- When trying to form habits, try making it part of your identity first
- Rather than saying, "I will go to the gym everyday". Start by saying, "I am a healthy person"
- This will make you start going in the 'healthy person' direction and going to the gym becomes one of the activities in the process

## Implementation intention
- When starting to form a habit, try to set an implementation intention
- Instead of saying, "I will go to the gym" (which is a goal intention), say, "As soon as finish my work at 5 in the evening, I will head to the gym in front of my house"
- This creates a specific time and place to perform your habit and makes it clear to your brain what the trigger for the habit is
- If it's a generic goal like going to the gym or reading a book, there's nothing triggering you to perform the habit. You'll probably procrastinate and never do it

## Habit Stacking
- If you're trying to build a habit, try stacking it on top of existing behaviours or habits
- For example, lets say you want to do your skin care routine every night. If you already brush your teeth every night before bed, set a goal of doing the skin care as soon as you finish brushing
- This gives you an exact **time and place**, an accurate cue, to do your habit making it easy to form the habit

## Environment
- Your environment or the context where you want to build habits matters a lot
- To build habits, try to set your environment so that it supports that habit formation
- For example, if you want to read a book, make sure you have a place in the house where you're comfortable reading a book. Maybe also keep the book in every room to remind you that you need to pick it up and read, for however short or long it is
- This is why it's also better to have separate spaces for each activity
    - Your bed is meant to give you rest so it's better not to associate it with anything else like working or playing, etc
    - Have a designated space for your work so that every time you sit there, your brain gets itself into the state of working
    - Kitchen is for cooking/doing the dishes so don't associate it with any other activity
- Visual cues help in habit formation. If you want to play the guitar, don't put it somewhere in your cupboard where you don't see it. Instead, keep it clearly visible so you see it everyday and are able to pick it up and play easily
- The same goes for negative habits. If you want to stop having chocoloates, keep them deep down in the fridge or any place that makes it hard to obtain it
- There's a study that's shown that, in retail stores, customers are likely to buy items on higher shelves than lower. And expensive items are usually kept in very visible places and the cheap ones are thrown at the back
- Set your environment so that it fosters habit formation
