## Characters
- Cheese, being the metaphor for what we want to have in life
- 4 characters
	- 2 mice: Sniff and Scurry
	- 2 littlepeople: Hem and Haw

## Beginning
- They're all living in a maze where there's cheese at random locations.
- They try to look for cheese everyday. One day, both the mice and the littlepeople find cheese at Cheese Station C.
- All of them remember the location and get their cheese from the same place every day since there's a lot of it.
- Hem and haw move their house close to it. Cheese was something they thought of as happiness. They called their friends and showed off what they had and almost took it for granted as the cheese they found would be enough for a long long time.

## A Change
- One day, the mice get to the Cheese Station C and notice that the cheese is gone. They weren't surprised. They already noticed that the cheese was getting smaller every day.
- The mice did not over-analyze things. For them, the problem and solution were simple. The situation at Cheese Station C changed, so they had to change. They set off to find a new cheese.
- The littlepeople however, saw that the cheese was gone and were completely shocked. They weren't noticing the small changes every day. "No cheese?", "*Who moved my Cheese?*" they shouted!

## Littlepeople Dealing with Change
- In my opinion, Haw seemed more sad/disappointed about not having cheese anymore whereas Hem seemed more furious. Angry about how something like this could happen to them. It was almost as if it shouldn't/couldn't/wouldn't have happened to them. "It's unfair", "Why did they do this to me?"
- They kept analyzing the situation. They got out of their homes and went back to Cheese Station C hoping it'd be there but with no luck of finding cheese they went into thinking.
- Haw thought about where Sniff and Scurry might have gone and asked Hem.
- Hem discarded this thought by saying that it does not matter because the mice were not as smart as the littlepeople. That the littlepeople were entitled to have the cheese.

## Denying The Change
- Hem was stubborn and denied trying to find a new location where they might find cheese.
- Haw started getting thoughts of Sniff and Scurry finding cheese and suggested that they start looking for a new place.
- Hem rejected this idea by saying that Cheese Station C was their comfortable place since they knew it so well. He added that other parts of the maze might be dangerous and they might get lost easily.
- Hearing this, Haw's fear of failing returned and the thought of finding a new place faded out.
- Day by day, they grew more frustrated because of the lack of cheese. Hem suggested they stay at the Cheese Station, maybe it would reappear. No luck again.
- Hem thought there was no change at all and that the cheese might just be nearby. They started making holes and breaking down walls. No luck again.

## Haw Realizes and Accepts Change
- After a long time of waiting for the cheese to reappear, Haw starts laughing at the whole situation. He finds it funny how they've been waiting for the cheese to appear whereas they should have started to find a new one long ago.
- Hem still tried pull him down by asking questions like "What if there is no cheese out there?" or "What if you don't find it even if it's there?". Haw didn't care. He had to do something.
- Haw started to think to himself. He wondered where he could possibly find the cheese. The thought of him venturing out to the maze put a smile on his face.
- He feels confident and gathers the courage to set out to find this new cheese.
- He says to Hem, "Sometimes, Hem, things change and they're never the same again. This looks like one of those times. Life moves on. And so should we"
- Hem thought, "Who moved my Cheese?"; Haw thought, "Why didn't I move with the Cheese sooner?"

## Getting Out of The Comfort Zone

**"What would I do if I weren't afraid?"**

- Haw still feared going into the maze with so many unknowns.
- Fear is not always bad. When you think that things are going to get worse, it can prompt you to take an action. But being too afraid or fearful, can keep you from taking any action at all.
- When Haw felt these fears going in a certain direction, he took a deep breath and faced it by going in that direction.
- He decided that if this were to happen to him ever again, he would get out of his comfort zone and adapt to change sooner.
- He wished to find enough cheese and take some back to Hem but he didn't feel confident enough that Hem would still agree to take this confusing path in the maze.
- It was not easy to find new cheese. He found it very challenging. Sometimes he thought if it was even a good idea to start finding new cheese. But as soon as he had discouraging thoughts, he negated them by reminding himself what he was doing and how it was much better than staying at Cheese Station C.
- He also realized that the old cheese didn't just disappear, it was getting smaller every day. He was just not paying attention. It was growing old as well.

**"When you stop being afraid, you feel good!"**

**"Imagining yourself enjoying new cheese leads you to it"**

## Positive Shift in Haw

**"The quicker you let go of old cheese, the sooner you find new cheese"**

**"It is safer to search in the maze than remain in a cheeseless situation"**

- Haw was finding bits and pieces of cheese in every station
- He even brought back some to Hem but Hem refused to take it. Still denying the change. "I want my cheese", he said.
- Haw was disappointed by Hem's response but he left to find more cheese.
- He realized that it was not just the cheese that was making him happy, it was also the fact that he was not run by his fears that made him happy.
- Haw realizes that it is natural for changes to occur continuously.
- His old thinking was clouded by his fears.
- His new beliefs were also introducing new behaviours.
- He didn't behave the same every time he encountered a new empty Cheese Station.

**"Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to the bigger changes that are to come"**

## Haw Finds Cheese!
- Haw finds Cheese Station N where Sniff and Scurry are there and they celebrate all the cheese they've found.
- Haw realizes that, along with other things, him laughing at his situation (of waiting for old cheese to reappear) helped him change.
- He learns from Sniff and Scurry:
	- They keep life simple
	- They didn't over-analyze
	- They didn't over complicate things
	- When situation changed, they moved
- He realized that you could learn to deal with change and that nothing gets better until you change
- He knew that some fears should be respected as it keeps you out of danger. But most of them are irrational, they keep us from changing.
