# Kotlin Compilation
1. Kotlin's compiler, kotlinc, takes `.kt` files as input and generates bytecode as `.class` files.
2. These `.class` files are same as the ones generated by Java code
3. The JVM is able to run these `.class` files regardless of the language it is written in
4. However, note that when running Kotlin applications, you need the Kotlin runtime library along with JRE otherwise the application won't run.
5. This is because there are some Kotlin specific code required to run Kotlin applications like the Kotlin standard library
