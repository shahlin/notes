# Revenue model
## Customers
1. Start with 150 customers as a goal
2. Start with friends and family, then ask for guests to post about it on their blogs or post on your blog, then maybe do some kind of marketing like Google Ads, etc
3. After reaching the target of 150, aim for 250 and so on

## Pricing
1. Have a goal amount that you want to achieve. For example, $10,000.
2. Start providing tiered pricing options. Like basic, professional, etc
3. _Some companies will give you a cheque or pay you just for an idea. If you just sell them the idea and the promise of you building it_
4. Add coupons/discounts! Customers will buy a product if they see that the product cost 99$ but you're giving it for 49$. Even if the original pricing was 49$
5. Or ask some bloggers/influencers to provide affiliate links
6. Basically, charge more money!
7. Have annual pre-pay option. And add discounts on them if customer does decide to do annual payments

> Use the **boutique** model: Shop with only 1 or 2 people in it. Very expensive. Barely ever open. They answer your email. You get incredible attention because the work is really good and unique

### Tips to price annual subscriptions
1. Coupon for 3 months free
2. Increase the monthly rate and increase the annual discount rate
3. Raise the damn prices! Jason said that. But if you aren't charging enough, then you should try doubling your price or at least 50% of it
4. Have 3-4 tiers/plans. Highlight the middle one
5. Have a business plan
6. Instead of giving free trials, give 60 day money back guarantee
7. Don't pick up pennies. Like some small percent of commission on some transaction. Just charge alot!


# Market model
## Type of audience
1. Never sell to customers
2. Customers are not willing to spend money on anything
3. Sell to businesses. B2B all the way

## Bad market choices
1. Point in time / Temporary pain products
    - Wedding related products for example. Customers will only use this once _probably_ or at most a few times. Plus, you need to find customers exactly the time when they're getting married or at least close to it
    - Any events related product
2. Viral products
3. Marketplace
    - Place where you bring together buyers and sellers
    - It's like two businesses. One, getting the products to put on the product (sellers). Other, buyers, you need to find buyers

## Good market choices
1. Naturally recurring
    - Financial, HR, reconciliation, taxes, invoicing etc.
    - Social media marketing, email marketing, A/B testing
    - Support - Might be difficult because you need to give human hours for this. But you can charge more for it. For example, pay a 100$ more and have higher priority
2. Not real time
    - Products that are not required immediately otherwise if delayed, it can be a problem to customers
    - For example, invoicing software. It's okay to fix a bug a little late. Immediate fixing is not required. Of course, it's good to have the fix but we can live with it another day
    - Project management tools. If JIRA dies for a day, you're not going to change JIRA for another product, you'll give them the time to fix the issue (hopefully soon)
3. Product that can be finished (not requiring too much work afterwards)
    - WinZip, time tracking, bug tracking, pdf editor
4. After markets
    - Something that helps/enhances the journey of using another product
    - Example: WooThemes for Wordpress, Photoshop plugins

## Market size - BIG!
1. Aim for a bigger market. Even if building a niche product, look to expand to a bigger market
2. It's okay if the product already exists. 

# What comes after?
1. Sell before you're too big
2. Sell to business partners
3. Sell to your biggest customer
4. Raise prices
5. Raise money (leave bootstrapping)

# Final note
> **Predictable** acquisition of **recurring** revenue with **annual** prepay in a **good market** creates a **cash machine**
