- 4 characters
	- 2 mice: Sniff and Scurry
	- 2 littlepeople: Hem and Haw

## Beginning
- They're all living in a maze where there's cheese at random locations.
- They try to look for cheese everyday. One day, both the mice and the littlepeople find cheese at Cheese Station C.
- All of them remember the location and get their cheese from the same place every day since there's a lot of it.
- Hem and haw move their house close to it. Cheese was something they thought of as happiness. They called their friends and showed off what they had and almost took it for granted as the cheese they found would be enough for a long long time.

## A Change
- One day, the mice get to the Cheese Station C and notice that the cheese is gone. They weren't surprised. They already noticed that the cheese was getting smaller every day.
- The mice did not over-analyze things. For them, the problem and solution were simple. The situation at Cheese Station C changed, so they had to change. They set off to find a new cheese.
- The littlepeople however, saw that the cheese was gone and were completely shocked. They weren't noticing the small changes every day. "No cheese?", "*Who moved my Cheese?*" they shouted!

## Littlepeople Dealing with Change
- In my opinion, Haw seemed more sad/disappointed about not having cheese anymore whereas Hem seemed more furious. Angry about how something like this could happen to them. It was almost as if it shouldn't/couldn't/wouldn't have happened to them. "It's unfair", "Why did they do this to me?"
- They kept analyzing the situation. They got out of their homes and went back to Cheese Station C hoping it'd be there but with no luck of finding cheese they went into thinking.
- Haw thought about where Sniff and Scurry might have gone and asked Hem.
- Hem discarded this thought by saying that it does not matter because the mice were not as smart as the littlepeople. That the littlepeople were entitled to have the cheese.

## Denying The Change
- Hem was stubborn and denied trying to find a new location where they might find cheese.
- Haw started getting thoughts of Sniff and Scurry finding cheese and suggested that they start looking for a new place.
- Hem rejected this idea by saying that Cheese Station C was their comfortable place since they knew it so well. He added that other parts of the maze might be dangerous and they might get lost easily.
- Hearing this, Haw's fear of failing returned and the thought of finding a new place faded out.
- Day by day, they grew more frustrated because of the lack of cheese. Hem suggested they stay at the Cheese Station, maybe it would reappear. No luck again.
- Hem thought there was no change at all and that the cheese might just be nearby. They started making holes and breaking down walls. No luck again.
