> [!Summary]
This chapter mainly discusses how John F. Kennedy (JFK) kept his composure while having to make one of the biggest decisions and that helped him make the right decisions

## The Problem

- The problem being discussed in this chapter is the construction of nuclear missile sites in Cuba by the Soviets. Each of these missiles capable of washing out entire cities.
- JFK was born into a family with a mindset of "Don't get mad, get even". He didn't have prior leadership experience and hence had failed in the first few years of leadership.
- There were lots of questions like why would the Soviets do this? How to solve this issue? What were the options? The fate of millions depended on these answers.
- Kennedy's advisors were all in for making a surprise attack and destroying all the nuclear missile sites using all of America's military power. Their thinking: Aggression must be met with aggression.
- Kennedy instead, wanted everyone to slow down and think about the problem at hand. Kennedy used to draw/write out words on paper like "Missile. Missile. Missile." as a meditative process. He then finally wrote in a short sentence that he demands the withdrawal of the missiles.
- He had finally decided to have a blockade of Cuba. More like a quarantine zone. This was the least aggressive move which most of the advisors looked down on because they'd rather fight it out.
- But everyone was very open, collaborative, no finger-pointing, etc. If Kennedy felt that there were members not being able to discuss some issues freely with his presence, he'd simply leave so they could discuss among themselves. He also invited the previous presidents as counsel while having these discussions.
- Not sure how the blockade really helped but as per the author it gave the space for Khrushev (from the Soviets) to think clearly. 11 days into the crisis, the Soviets wrote a letter to Kennedy saying that they saw that the _two of them were pulling on a rope with a knot in the middle - knot of war_.

## Takeaway
- Kennedy was calm and composed while thinking of the problem even though it was a huge one involving the lives of millions of people.
- He had the wisdom, clear thinking, patience and a keen eye for the root of a complex problem which helped him save the country.
- We need to draw upon the same _stillness_ that Kennedy had. We must:
	- Be fully present
	- Empty our mind of preconceptions
	- Take our time
	- Sit quietly and reflect
	- Reject distraction
