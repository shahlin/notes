# Domain of the Mind

> [!Summary]
This chapter mainly discusses how John F. Kennedy (JFK) kept his composure while having to make one of the biggest decisions and that helped him make the right decisions

## The Problem

- The problem being discussed in this chapter is the construction of nuclear missile sites in Cuba by the Soviets. Each of these missiles capable of washing out entire cities.
- JFK was born into a family with a mindset of "Don't get mad, get even". He didn't have prior leadership experience and hence had failed in the first few years of leadership.
- There were lots of questions like why would the Soviets do this? How to solve this issue? What were the options? The fate of millions depended on these answers.
- Kennedy's advisors were all in for making a surprise attack and destroying all the nuclear missile sites using all of America's military power. Their thinking: Aggression must be met with aggression.
- Kennedy instead, wanted everyone to slow down and think about the problem at hand. Kennedy used to draw/write out words on paper like "Missile. Missile. Missile." as a meditative process. He then finally wrote in a short sentence that he demands the withdrawal of the missiles.
- He had finally decided to have a blockade of Cuba. More like a quarantine zone. This was the least aggressive move which most of the advisors looked down on because they'd rather fight it out.
- But everyone was very open, collaborative, no finger-pointing, etc. If Kennedy felt that there were members not being able to discuss some issues freely with his presence, he'd simply leave so they could discuss among themselves. He also invited the previous presidents as counsel while having these discussions.
- Not sure how the blockade really helped but as per the author it gave the space for Khrushev (from the Soviets) to think clearly. 11 days into the crisis, the Soviets wrote a letter to Kennedy saying that they saw that the _two of them were pulling on a rope with a knot in the middle - knot of war_.

## Takeaway
- Kennedy was calm and composed while thinking of the problem even though it was a huge one involving the lives of millions of people.
- He had the wisdom, clear thinking, patience and a keen eye for the root of a complex problem which helped him save the country.
- We need to draw upon the same _stillness_ that Kennedy had. We must:
	- Be fully present
	- Empty our mind of preconceptions
	- Take our time
	- Sit quietly and reflect
	- Reject distraction

# Become Present

> [!Summary]
The basic idea is just being present. Using all of 'you' to be in the current moment. Leaving the past and future aside and just focusing on the present

- One of the key figures in this chapter is Marina Abramovic. She's a conceptual artist - which I have no idea what it means. Upon a quick Google search, it looks like she's a performance artist. Could be role playing, music, etc.
- Marina spent about 3 months in one of her performances just sitting and observing the audience. They'd sit in front of her one after the other doing or saying nothing. Just being.
- The chapter mentions how still and present she was. She didn't let thoughts come in the way or the need to eat/drink something or the need to visit the bathroom. She stayed in the moment with full focus, giving all of her.
- _"People don't understand that the hardest thing to do is actually doing something that is close to nothing"_

# Limit Your Inputs

> [!Summary]
Especially in today's time, there's alot of information we're taking in. The goal is to take in only what's necessary and leave the unimportant ones out so as to keep our mind clean and focused on what really matters

- Napolean had this rule of not checking his mail for 3 weeks. This way, he found out that there were lots of matters that were resolved without his intervention. They seemed important enough to involve him but were really not.
- This feels relatable in today's world where, as a developer, if there's an issue a junior is having, asking you would be the first thing they do. If not replied soon enough, they eventually find the answer or find a way to resolve the issue.
- Napolean also preferred not listening to the good news in the morning because they don't need tending to. Instead he'd like the bad ones so he had all the time (rest of the day) to work on them.
- The goal is to make sure we're letting in information that really needs to come in. For example, a random notification on your phone from McDonald's app is useless and adds no value while you're working on something. Having a look at it or hearing the notification can be a distraction to the mind.
- Even consuming the news might just be adding to this. Unnecessary news at least
- Cutting down inputs to your mind is the goal. Garbage in, garbage out. If you want good output, you need to watch over your inputs.
- From the book, "It is in this stillness that we can be present and finally see the truth. It is in this stillness that we can hear the voice inside us"

# Empty Your Mind

> [!Summary]
Try keeping your mind free of distractions or thoughts when you want full focus

- Example given in this chapter is of a baseball player named Shawn Green. At a point in his career, he was having a hard time playing well. He had lots of thoughts going on in his head - What are the fans gonna say? What's the news gonna show? What's the coach gonna think?
- He was one of the players who practiced Buddhism. He recalled his learnings about the zen state during this situation he was in.
- All he needed was to shut off all the thoughts in his head and hit the ball. Not overthinking, not worrying, not being distracted. Just hit the ball.
- I know its easier said than done but that's the goal
- When he got inside the pitch, he had hit a lot of home runs and just scored high (for the lack of baseball knowledge) making him one of the few players in the history of baseball to hit 4 home runs in a single game.
- How he achieved it was by keeping his mind empty. When he started scoring, he saw the crowd/teammates cheer. This can obviously boost your ego sometimes. But he discarded these thoughts too and continued playing.
- Epictetus says, "If we're anxious or nervous when we make the catch or throw, what will become of the game, and how can one maintain one's composure; how can one see what is coming next?"
